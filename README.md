## Greetings
Hey! My name is Javaughn Smith. I'm a Software Developer, and this is the repo for my portfolio website which is linked above. I invite you to go check it out!

## Description
As shown on the repo landing page, I built this website using HTML and CSS, naturally, as well as JavaScript - specifically, React.js - to make the web page responsive and also to make it accessible on mobile devices. (Still working on that last part, so please bear with me!)

On my website, you'll find a bit more information about me - what I do, how I do it - and some of the things I have worked/am working on, which I write about on occasion in the form of [blog entries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dkMhavEo6vvuaJclAmEFLJl_hYpnJ_7YlzYwBzZhiGg/edit).

Please feel free to poke around this repo and see how I put my website together.
